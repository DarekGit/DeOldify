This determines resolution at which the color portion of the video is rendered. Lower resolution will render faster, and colors also tend to look more vibrant. Older and lower quality film in particular will generally benefit by lowering the render factor. Higher render factors are often better for higher quality videos and inconsistencies (flashy render) will generally be reduced, but the colors may get slightly washed out.\n",

We want to help promote this as a standard, especially as the technology continues to improve and the distinction between real and fake becomes harder to discern.

        "1. If a video takes a long time to render and you're wondering how well the frames will actually be colorized, you can preview how well the frames will be rendered at each render_factor by using the code at the bottom. Just stop the video rendering by hitting the stop button on the cell, then run that bottom cell under \"See how well render_factor values perform on a frame here\". It's not perfect and you may still need to experiment a bit especially when it comes to figuring out how to reduce frame inconsistency.  But it'll go a long way in narrowing down what actually works.\n",
        "2. If videos are taking way too much time for your liking, running the Jupyter notebook VideoColorizer.ipynb on your own machine (with DeOldify installed) will generally be much faster (as long as you have the hardware for it).   \n",
        "3. Longer videos (running multiple minutes) are going to have a rough time on Colabs. You'll be much better off using a local install of DeOldify instead in this case.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Troubleshooting\n",
        "The video player may wind up not showing up, in which case- make sure to wait for the Jupyter cell to complete processing first (the play button will stop spinning).  Then follow these alternative download instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. In the menu to the left, click Files\n",
        "2. If you don't see the 'DeOldify' folder, click \"Refresh\"\n",
        "3. By default, rendered video will be in /DeOldify/video/result/\n",
        "\n",
        "If a video you downloaded doesn't play, it's probably because the cell didn't complete processing and the video is in a half-finished state."
